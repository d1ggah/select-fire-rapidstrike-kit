# select-fire-rapidstrike-kit
A fork of https://github.com/Suild/select-fire-rapidstrike-kit  

Sadly Suild's board kits are no longer available to buy from their website. Therefore I started this fork to enable people to build their own boards by providing the missing information from Suild's schematics.
I will also attempt to integrate a small OLED screen into the code.

Note this is currently a work in progress and very little has changed from the original
