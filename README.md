# select-fire-rapidstrike-kit
A fork of https://github.com/Suild/select-fire-rapidstrike-kit  

Sadly Suild's board kits are no longer available to buy from their website. Therefore I started this fork to enable people to build their own boards by providing the missing information from Suild's schematics.
I will also attempt to integrate a small OLED screen into the code.

Note this project is currently on hold. The necessary Mosfets and ICs are hard to get hold of and alternatives are equally hard to acquire making the search fruitless in the current chip shortage.
